## Read Serial Data
This script reads serial data from the Arduino-Uno board, collects the data
in the 'Data' variable and plots it. The script also calculates the
sampling rate at which the data is collected.

## Monitor Serial Data
This script continuously reads serial data from the Arduino-Uno board and
plots it (like an oscilloscope) using a while loop. To quit the loop
(stop viewing) press ctrl+c
